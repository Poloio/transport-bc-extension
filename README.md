# A worthy first AL extension
*It's not the ride, I'ts the rider.*  

This repository doesn't need a lengthy explanation, but I'm doing it anyways so I can practice my markdown. Maybe not many people will see it before this README in particular, but oh well. Better get practice now and get used to write lengthy documentation is this format. Maybe my future employers will appreciate that and think I'm a better coder than I am. Oh boy, here we go.

This is a **Business Central** extension, used to upload all my test files and exercises. Alberto, if your're seen this, you're an absolute unit. It was conceived at first to be a *theme* extension about a transportation agency, but I ended up using it for all my exercises as an intern. Maybe that's not the best structure for a public repository, but f\*ck that. I'm writing this as an entertainment anyways. 

I would talk about how this extension works and which files do what, but to be honest I can't remember.

Thank you for reading this frustrated coder's gibberish.
